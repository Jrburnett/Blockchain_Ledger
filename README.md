## Steps for completing the project

### Step 1 Create a Record Data
In this step I defined a data class called Record, followed by adding three attributes, sender, reciever,
and amount
### Step 2 Modify the existing block data class to store the recorded data
In this step I renamed the data variable to record in order to keep a record of the data we created in the
previous section.
### Step 3 add revelant user inputs to stream lit
In this section we coded additional inputs in our stream lit web application which included,
sender data, reciever data, and amount data.
### Step 4 Test the application
In this section I tested the application and took screenshots of the results which can be seen below.
